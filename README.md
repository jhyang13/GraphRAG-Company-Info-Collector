This project aims to build a scalable company information collection system using Neo4j-based knowledge graphs and integrating large language models (LLMs) to enhance data extraction and analysis.

### Project Goals
- Develop a knowledge graph to organize and retrieve company-related information effectively, supporting informed business decisions.
- Use Cypher queries for knowledge graph retrieval, combined with LLMs to enhance data extraction accuracy.

### Modules Overview
- **Data Input and Preprocessing**
  - Preprocess raw company data to fit the graph database structure.
  - Set up the Neo4j environment and import data.

- **Knowledge Graph Construction**
  - Define entities (e.g., company, industry, people, products) and relationships.
  - Insert data into Neo4j with a structured graph schema.

- **Cypher Graph Querying**
  - Create basic to advanced Cypher queries for company information extraction.
  - Retrieve entity relationships, detect patterns, and extract structured information.
  - Demonstrate complex queries for analyzing relationships between companies.

- **RAG and LLM Integration**
  - Introduce GraphRAG (combining knowledge graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for dynamic information retrieval).
  - Enhance information extraction accuracy using LLMs to query the knowledge graph.

- **Project Use Case: Business Decision Support**
  - Collect and analyze target company information for real business challenges.
  - Show how insights from the knowledge graph and LLM analysis support business decisions.

### Key Technologies
  - **Graph Database** concepts and Neo4j operations.
  - **Cypher** for querying graph databases.
  - **LLM integration** to enhance data retrieval.
  - **Knowledge Graph Visualization** techniques.
  - **Data Analysis and Summary Presentation** skills.

### Prerequisites
  - Basic Python programming skills.
  - Understanding of database concepts.
  - Initial knowledge of LLMs.

### Tools & Software
  - **Neo4j**: for knowledge graph construction and querying.
  - **Python** (Numpy, Pandas, Neo4j driver, visualization libraries)
  - **Cypher**: Neo4jâ€™s query language.
  - **OpenAI API** (LLM calls; token usage fees apply)
  - **Langchain**: framework for working with large models.
  - **GitHub**: for version control and code management.

### Project Deliverables
  - Complete Neo4j knowledge graph.
  - A set of Cypher query scripts for company information retrieval.
  - Python scripts for data extraction and processing integrated with LLMs.
  - A presentation document (PPT) summarizing insights from the knowledge graph and LLM analyses.

### Learning Outcomes
  - Master the process of building knowledge graphs from scratch.
  - Develop expertise in Cypher queries for complex data pattern retrieval.
  - Learn to integrate LLMs with GraphRAG for efficient information retrieval.
  - Improve data visualization and business decision presentation skills.
  - Gain practical experience in project management, programming, and data science.
